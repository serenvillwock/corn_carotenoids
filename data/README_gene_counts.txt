Sweetcorn TagSeq v1 Counts

Sample Naming: Sample name contains the Plate, Well, Sample ID, and Accession (in order)

Raw Counts were rlog normalized

Additional Info: gene functional annotation, chromosome, and position also included for B73. Chromosome, position, best arabidopsis hit, best arabidopsis hit annotation were provided for PH207 as a functional annotation is not currently available.

v1 = All samples passing our QC. Samples were filtered out if flagged by the genome center as contaminated (12), had less than 250,000 initial reads (3). Attempted to use a minimum cutoff of 65% overall alignment but all samples passed this criterion.
